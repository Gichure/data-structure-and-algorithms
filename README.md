### Data Structure and Algorithms
Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data for efficient use. In this series, you will get great understanding on Data Structures needed to understand the complexity of enterprise level applications and need of algorithms and data structures. Good understanding of DSA helps address the following problems;  
1.  Enormous Data Search
2.  Limited Processor speed
3.  Handling multiple requests
